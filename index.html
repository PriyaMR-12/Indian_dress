                        Clothing in India varies with the different ethnicities, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of the people of each region of India.
                         Historically, clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina, langota, achkan, lungi, sari, to rituals and dance performances. 
                         In urban areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all social levels. 
                         India also has a great diversity in terms of weaves, fibers, colors, and the material of clothing. Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned.
                         The clothing in India also encompasses a wide variety of Indian embroidery, prints, handwork, embellishments, and styles of wearing clothes. 
                        A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India.

                        The Indus Valley Civilization is said to be the origin of everything.
                         The Bronze Age of Civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, which spanned from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, is when the earliest records of traditional Indian dress were discovered.
                         Long before the fashion industry ever started to make its first moves, the Indian textile sector was growing. 
                         Long before the time of colonialism, India had begun exporting cotton and silk. Around 300 BCE, India learned how to make silk from the Chinese. 
                         Many locations across India became become hubs for silk weaving. These were mostly locations like Delhi, Cochin, Gujarat, and Varanasi.
                          Silk swiftly gained popularity among the nation’s royals because of its softness and opulent feel.

               A sari (sometimes also saree or shari) is a women's garment from the Indian subcontinent, that consists of an un-stitched stretch of woven fabric arranged over the body as a robe, with one end attached to the waist, while the other end rests over one shoulder as a stole (shawl), sometimes baring a part of the midriff.
               In the vibrant mosaic of Indian culture, the saree not only stands as a symbol of tradition but for many other values, such as: 
               Respect for Elders and Family Values:
                In Indian culture, wearing a saree is more than just a fashion choice; it's a sign of respect for elders and family values

                    Anarkalis are a type of traditional Indian clothing that dates back to the Mughal era. The dress is made up of a long, flowing frock-style top that stretches out from the waist down. 
                    It is often worn with a churidar bottom and a dupatta.
                    This dress is generally worn by Kathak dancers. With the development, the mid-length and floor-length anarkali became popular. 
                    The demand is finally increasing, and it is one of the most popular salwar kameez styles.
                     It is known for its long, flowing kurtas that beautifully complement every woman's look.
